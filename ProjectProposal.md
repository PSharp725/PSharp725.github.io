# Project Proposal
- - -
## Building the Foundation for Game Engine Development
- - -
### Vision Statement

For this project, I propose focusing on **developing key technical skills essential for game engine development**. My long-term goal is to build a game engine, and I have been exploring various resources to determine the best way to begin this journey.

Given the limited time scope of this class, I aim to concentrate on three critical areas: **design patterns, domain/hardware knowledge, and data structures & algorithms**. Strengthening these foundational skills will provide a structured approach to understanding game engine architecture and improving my ability to build efficient systems.

To achieve this, I plan to:

- **Deepen my understanding of software architecture and design patterns**, which are crucial for game engine development and broader software engineering roles.
   
- **Strengthen my C++ programming skills**, a widely used language in game development and performance-critical applications.

- **Establish a strong theoretical foundation in game engine architecture** before attempting full-scale development.
    
- **Develop the ability to analyze and implement key systems** found in game engines (e.g., rendering, physics, input handling).
    
- **Enhance problem-solving and algorithmic thinking** through structured LeetCode exercises, applicable in both technical interviews and game engine development.

- **Build a structured learning approach** that can be expanded into future projects or professional work in game development.

### Motivation

I have always been passionate about game development and have long aspired to build my own game engine. However, **a lack of foundational knowledge has been a significant barrier** preventing me from starting this journey. I want to ensure that I have a strong grasp of the core principles necessary to develop an engine that meets high-quality standards.

Additionally, my current work primarily involves **Python**, and I see this project as an opportunity to **re-engage with a lower-level, strongly-typed, compiled language like C++**. Strengthening my proficiency in C++ will not only enhance my ability to work with performance-critical systems but also prepare me for the complex architectural challenges involved in game engine development.

### Specific and Measurable Goals

To ensure steady progress and accountability, I have outlined **specific and measurable learning objectives**:

- **Solve two LeetCode problems per week**, focusing on algorithmic thinking and C++ problem-solving.

- **Read and analyze one to two chapters of _Design Patterns_ by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides per week** to develop a strong understanding of common design principles.

- **Implement key design patterns in small, practical projects** whenever possible (e.g., Singleton, Factory, Observer).

- **Read one to two chapters of _Game Engine Architecture_ by Jason Gregory per week** and summarize key architectural components.

- **Apply learned concepts by building a small prototype** demonstrating core game engine principles whenever feasible.

### Risks to Project Completion 

- **Time Management:** Balancing coursework, work, and personal commitments may impact progress.

- **Technical Complexity:** Some advanced concepts, especially in game engine architecture and design patterns, may be difficult to grasp without prior experience.

- **Scope Creep:** There is a risk of **expanding beyond foundational skills** into full-fledged game engine development, which is not feasible within the project's time-frame.

- **Motivation and Consistency:** Maintaining consistent progress across all learning objectives can be challenging.

### Mitigation Strategy

- - **Time Management:** Create a structured weekly schedule with dedicated study and coding time to ensure steady progress.

- **Technical Complexity:** Leverage additional resources such as **online courses, forums, and academic papers** to supplement learning.

- **Scope Creep:** Define clear boundariesâ€”focus on **learning key concepts rather than attempting a full implementation** of a game engine.

 - **Motivation and Consistency:** Track progress using my **personal website** to document key takeaways, completed exercises, and insights.

### Project Deliverables and Assessments

- **Documented LeetCode solutions** from my weekly problem-solving exercises.

- **Small implementations of design patterns** with explanations of their relevance to game engine development.

 - **Journal-like entries on my personal website**, summarizing insights from readings and key takeaways.

- **Prototypes and code snippets** showcasing the application of learned concepts in a practical manner.
