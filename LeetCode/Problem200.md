# Number of Islands

### Problem Description

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return the number of islands.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands **horizontally or vertically**. You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

### Example 1:

**Input:**

```
grid = [
["1","1","1","1","0"],
["1","1","0","1","0"],
["1","1","0","0","0"],
["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
```

**Output:** `1`

### Example 2:

**Input:**

```
grid = [
["1","1","0","0","0"],
["1","1","0","0","0"],
["0","0","1","0","0"],
["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
```

**Output:** `3`

### Constraints:

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`

### Solution

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(vector<vector<char>>& grid, int i, int j) {
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();

        if (i < 0 || i >= m || j < 0 || j >= n || grid[i][j] == '0')
            return;

        grid[i][j] = '0';  // mark as visited

        dfs(grid, i + 1, j); // down
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j); // up
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1); // right
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1); // left
    }

    int numIslands(vector<vector<char>>& grid) {
        if (grid.empty())
            return 0;

        int count = 0;
        int m = grid.size();
        int n = grid[0].size();

        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (grid[i][j] == '1') {
                    dfs(grid, i, j);
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```
