## Building the Foundation for Game Engine Development

---

### Introduction

My project aimed to develop foundational technical skills essential for game engine development, focusing primarily on software architecture, design patterns, C++ programming proficiency, theoretical knowledge of game engine architecture, and algorithmic problem-solving skills. Initially, ambitious goals were set, but adjustments were made mid-semester due to time constraints to ensure steady progress and meaningful learning outcomes.

---

### Background

Developing a game engine has long been a professional aspiration. My current role heavily involves Python, creating a desire to reconnect deeply with C++ to effectively engage with performance-critical applications inherent in game development. Building these skills aligns closely with my career ambitions and professional growth, preparing me for complex challenges in software architecture and development.

---

### Methodology, Materials, and Methods

The methodology included structured reading, practical exercises, and reflective documentation. Primary materials consisted of:

- **Books:**
  - *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software* by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides
  - *Game Engine Architecture* by Jason Gregory

- **Algorithmic Practice:**
  - Regularly solving LeetCode problems to enhance algorithmic thinking and C++ proficiency.

- **Documentation:**
  - Reflective chapter summaries and insights published on my personal website.
  - Practical implementation of design patterns.

---

### Results

Over the course of the project, significant learning was achieved, including:

- **LeetCode Problem-Solving:** Completed and documented approximately 15 LeetCode problems, specifically selected for relevance to game engine concepts, including:
  - [Add Two Numbers](/LeetCode/Problem2/)
  - [Median of Two Sorted Arrays](/LeetCode/Problem4/)
  - [Unique Paths](/LeetCode/Problem62/)
  - [Merge Sorted Array](/LeetCode/Problem88/)
  - [Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traversal](/LeetCode/Problem105/)
  - [Binary Tree Maximum Path Sum](/LeetCode/Problem124/)
  - [Surrounded Regions](/LeetCode/Problem130/)
  - [LRU Cache](/LeetCode/Problem146/)
  - [Number of Islands](/LeetCode/Problem200/)
  - [The Skyline Problem](/LeetCode/Problem218/)
  - [Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree](/LeetCode/Problem236/)
  - [Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix](/LeetCode/Problem329/)
  - [Pacific Atlantic Water Flow](/LeetCode/Problem417/)

- **Reading and Reflection:** Successfully completed chapters one through four of both key texts, accompanied by structured reflections.

- **Design Patterns:** Implemented and documented the Abstract Factory pattern with a clear example relevant to game engine design.

- **Website Development:** Regular updates significantly enriched my personal website, providing an organized portfolio of my learning journey and outcomes.

### Discussion / Reflection

Despite initially setting overly ambitious goals, I successfully revised these targets mid-semester to maintain realistic and achievable milestones. Key strategies included allocating dedicated weekly time blocks specifically for this project, which allowed consistent progress despite multiple competing responsibilities. The structured documentation approach greatly enhanced my focus and effectiveness.

Challenges encountered were primarily related to time management, given concurrent commitments with work and other coursework. By realistically adjusting reading and implementation goals, I maintained steady progress, ultimately finishing stronger than anticipated by adding extensive new content to the website.

I am satisfied with the project results and excited to continue this learning path, especially now that my academic commitments are concluding. This project has reinforced my enthusiasm for developing a game engine and solidified my foundational skills in preparation for more advanced exploration.

### Conclusion

Reflecting on this project, I've gained valuable insights into disciplined self-learning and the importance of realistic goal-setting. My perspective on software architecture and game engine development has broadened and strengthened considerably. Looking forward, I plan to leverage this experience and additional time post-graduation to pursue my long-term goal of building a functional game engine. This project has provided a robust foundational understanding and practical experience, confirming my passion and direction for continued professional growth in game development.
